<p>The DVSA Design System is for everyone. It has a strong community behind it. It includes the latest research, design and development to represent and be relevant for its users.</p>
<p>Find out:</p>
<ul>
<li>how to <a href="/community/propose-a-component-or-pattern/">propose a component or pattern</a><!-- - how to [develop a component or pattern](/community/develop-a-component-or-pattern) --></li>
<li>what people are currently working on in the <a href="/community/backlog/">community backlog</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Learn how the <a href="/community/design-system-working-group/">Design System Working Group</a> reviews and approves components and patterns to confirm they meet the <a href="/community/contribution-criteria/">contribution criteria</a>.</p>
<h2 id="community-principles">Community principles</h2>
<p>These principles are for the community of people that create and contribute to government components and patterns.</p>
<h3 id="1-start-with-what-exists">1. Start with what exists</h3>
<p>Reuse as much as possible and iterate based on user needs.</p>
<p>Start by checking what exists in the <a href="https://gov.uk/design-system">GOV.UK Design System</a> and the <a href="/">DVSA Design System</a>.</p>
<p>If something is not in the Design System, check the <a href="/community/backlog/">community backlog</a> to see what colleagues in other teams have done before.</p>
<p>Reach out to the community to ask questions, gather examples and learn from othersâ€™ mistakes.</p>
<h3 id="2-contribute-back-and-help-others">2. Contribute back and help others</h3>
<p>The DVSA Design System is for everyone. Anyone can contribute evidenced-based changes.</p>
<p>Think beyond your service and aim to design components and patterns that are scalable, reusable and can evolve over time.</p>
<p>Share research findings and examples with others. Be open to feedback or changes to your work.</p>
<p>Above all, be kind. Encourage others to contribute by being respectful when asking questions or giving feedback.</p>
<h3 id="3-prioritise-openness-and-honesty">3. Prioritise openness and honesty</h3>
<p>Prioritise sharing components and patterns in the DVSA Design System and <a href="/community/backlog/">community backlog</a>. This makes them easier to find and reduces duplication of effort.</p>
<p>Share work in progress as early as possible. Be honest about the amount and nature of your research and findings. Share what works and what does not.</p>
<p>Promote awareness of existing work whenever possible.</p>
