    <p>The Design System is built upon the research and experience of teams across the DVSA.</p>
    <p>Anyone can propose, develop or contribute to new patterns and components, or improvements to existing ones.</p>
    <p>The <a href="#">community backlog</a> contains a list of components, patterns and updates. They can be:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Proposed</strong> – someone has suggested a new component or pattern</li>
    <li><strong>To do</strong> – the proposed component or pattern has been agreed and is ready to work on</li>
    <li><strong>In progress</strong> – someone is actively working on the component or pattern</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can discuss the existing styles, components and patterns in the Design System, or ones being developed, by commenting on issues in the <a href="#">community backlog</a>. </p>
    <p>For example, you can:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>ask questions about a style, component or pattern</li>
    <li>answer questions from other contributors</li>
    <li>share examples or demos of a component or pattern</li>
    <li>share research relating to a style, component or pattern</li>
    </ul>
