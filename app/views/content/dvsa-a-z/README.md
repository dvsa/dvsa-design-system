# DVSA style guide

The DVSA style guide covers style, spelling and grammar conventions that are not covered in the [government style guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide) or [Guardian and Observer style guide](https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-observer-style-guide-a), arranged alphabetically

## A

### annual test 

Lowercase. 

Avoid using. Write ‘MOT for an HGV, bus or trailer’ instead.

When it's essential to include it for search, write 'MOT (annual test)'.

### approved driving instructor (ADI) 

Lowercase.  

Only use when writing for people becoming an ADI or who are already an ADI.  

When writing for learner drivers and the public, use ‘driving instructor’ in full each time instead.

Avoid using. Write ‘MOT centre for HGVs, buses and trailers’ instead
