# Clearly DVSA

The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) runs a campaign to help its colleagues write clearly. It’s called Clearly DVSA.

Clearly DVSA helps you make your writing clear, useful and trusted.

## Clear

Simple, short and structured. Our writing is jargon-free and makes sense.

This means that we:

* use plain English
* use short sentences and paragraphs
* structure content with regular subheadings
* use lists
* research and use the words our users use, rather than using technical language

## Useful

Get straight to the point. Our writing tells people what they need to know and do.

This means that we:

* focus on user needs
* help people find information and services easily
* publish only what someone needs to complete their task
* write so that people can get to the answer, whether they’re reading a webpage, using a search engine or asking a smart speaker

## Trusted

Honest and confident. Our writing is free of errors, does not hide anything, and helps people stay safe.

This means that we:

* do not write in a way that hides anything
* make sure what write is not inaccurate or misleading
* check the spelling and grammar are right
* always remember that our content is used by people who need to do the legal and safe thing

## How to make your writing clear, useful and trusted
