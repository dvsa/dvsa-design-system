## Core user groups

Our core user groups have been created to help us ensure we test with all type of users when building our services. It also shows visitors of the DVSA design system the depth of user testing we have for particular components and patterns.

### Digital capability

We are using the great research done by GOV.UK on the [digital inclusion scale](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/government-digital-inclusion-strategy#a-digital-inclusion-scale-for-individuals) to help us ensure we test our components and patterns with users at different points across the level of digital capability and learn from them.

The digital inclusion scale for individuals has 9 points. It ranges from those people who may have consciously decided not to use the internet and therefore never have been online and never will, to experts whose primary income comes from online services. Basic digital skills, at point 7, is the minimum capability that people need to have in order to use the internet effectively.
