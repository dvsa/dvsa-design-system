The DVSA has a lot of different services, and therefore a lot of different users. we created our core user groups to help us ensure we test with all type of users when building our services. It also shows visitors of the DVSA design system the depth of user testing we have for particular components and patterns with these user groups.


## Core user groups

Our core user groups contain 5 categories. These categories are Digital capability, Accessibility, <b>Language and content / Audience</b>, Location and task complexity. Each category has sub categories for specific user needs.

### Digital capability

We are using the great research done by GOV.UK on the [digital inclusion scale](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/government-digital-inclusion-strategy#a-digital-inclusion-scale-for-individuals) to help us ensure we test our components and patterns with users at different points across the level of digital capability and learn from them.

you can find out more about the digital capability user group on the [designing for different digital capabilities](digital-capabilities) page.





### Accessibility

We have based our user groups in this core user group on the great work done at the Home Office on [designing accessible services](https://ukhomeoffice.github.io/accessibility-posters/). The guidance covers best design practices for users from these areas: low vision, D/deaf and hard of hearing, dyslexia, motor disabilities, users on the autistic spectrum and users of screen readers.
