We are using the great research done by GOV.UK on the [digital inclusion scale](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/government-digital-inclusion-strategy#a-digital-inclusion-scale-for-individuals) to help us ensure we test our components and patterns with users at different points across the level of digital capability and learn from them.

you can find out more about the Digital capability user group on the [designing for different digital capabilities](digital-capabilities) page.
