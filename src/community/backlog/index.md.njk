<p class="govuk-body">Anyone can propose, develop or contribute to new patterns and components, or improvements to existing ones.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">There is a private community backlog that contains a list of components, patterns and updates currently used across DVSA. They can be:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li><strong>Proposed</strong> – someone has suggested a new component or pattern</li>
  <li><strong>To do</strong> – the proposed component or pattern has been agreed and is ready to work on</li>
  <li><strong>In progress</strong> – someone is actively working on the component or pattern</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">If you want to discuss the existing styles, components and patterns in the DVSA Design System, or ones being developed, reach out to our DVSA design system team using the <a class="app-panel__link" target="_blank" href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=J7hVpE8kl0y1tM5dE7TQDPD3nEj9BlhDt0B0AIMsAuBURVkyRUNIQzQ3QjAwQ1pDREpZUlpCVzlINC4u">DVSA design system support form</a>. </p>
