## Core user groups

Our core user groups contain 5 categories. These categories are Digital capability, Accessibility, Language and context, Location and task complexity. Each category has sub categories for specific user needs.

### Digital capability

We are using the great research done by GOV.UK on the [digital inclusion scale](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/government-digital-inclusion-strategy#a-digital-inclusion-scale-for-individuals) to help us ensure we test our components and patterns with users at different points across the level of digital capability and learn from them.



### Accessibility

We have based our user groups in this core user group on the great work done at the Home Office on [designing accessible services](https://ukhomeoffice.github.io/accessibility-posters/). The guidance covers best design practices for users from these areas: low vision, D/deaf and hard of hearing, dyslexia, motor disabilities, users on the autistic spectrum and users of screen readers.
